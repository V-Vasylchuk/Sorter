# String Sorter

## Introduction

The `StringSorter` class is designed to sort a list of strings based on alphabetical order, with a special exception for strings that start with a specific prefix. The goal is to produce a readable and well-engineered solution.

Method
The `sortStrings` method takes two parameters:

* `unsortedStrings`: A list of strings to be sorted.
* `exceptionChar`: A prefix character. Strings starting with this character will be sorted in reverse alphabetical order and placed at the end of the sorted list.

## Usage

To use the `StringSorter` class, create an instance and call the sortStrings method with your list of strings and the exception prefix.

## Note

The emphasis in this assignment is on producing a readable and well-engineered solution, rather than performance optimizations.
